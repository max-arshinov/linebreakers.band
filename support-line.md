ðŸŽµ "Support Line" ðŸŽµ

(Verse 1)
There's a bug in your code, who you gonna call?
Support Line!
Your server's overload, who you gonna call?
Support Line!

(Chorus)
I ain't 'fraid of no crash!
I ain't 'fraid of no hack!

(Verse 2)
When your screen's all blue, and nothing's understood,
Who you gonna call?
Support Line!
When your printer's jammed, in the neighborhood,
Who you gonna call?
Support Line!

(Chorus)
I ain't 'fraid of no glitch!
I ain't 'fraid of no breach!

(Bridge)
If you're seeing things, running through your screen,
Who can you call?
Support Line!
An invisible bug, freaking you out,
Oh, who you gonna call?
Support Line!

(Outro)
When your network's down, or your files are gone,
You better call, Support Line!
Let me tell you something,
Bustin' makes me feel good!
